# 🏆 x402 Build Sprint - Starter Kit

> **x402 Build Sprint on Algobharat Dev Retreat**  
> **Duration:** 4 Hours |

---

## 📋 Event Overview

The x402 Build Sprint is a focused hackathon embedded within the Algobharat Dev Retreat. This is **NOT a traditional hackathon**. Teams are challenged to:

✅ **Identify a real business problem** - Not just a demo  
✅ **Build a product-quality interface** - Users don't see the complexity  
✅ **Implement 2+ x402 endpoints** - Real agents, real payments  
✅ **Get Green Cards verified** - Technical integrity matters  
✅ **Pitch in 3 minutes** - Clear, compelling communication  

**The Prize:** Teams that build genuine value with clean abstraction win.

## 🎯 4-Hour Sprint Timeline

| Time | Activity | Duration | Your Team |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **T+0:00** | Teams announced & Tokens distributed | 15 min | 🔄 Form team, get Consulting Tokens (×2) |
| **T+0:15** | Problem scoping & use case definition | 45 min | 🧠 Brainstorm real problems, sketch solution |
| **T+1:00** | **BUILD PHASE STARTS** | 90 min | ⚙️ Setup, code endpoints, get Green Cards verified |
| **T+2:30** | Final build & last Green Card checks

---

## 🎯 What Every Team Must Build

**Requirement 1: Define a Real Business Problem**  
Your use case must reflect genuine friction in a real domain. Example: *"Researchers waste hours finding relevant academic papers across multiple databases."*

**Requirement 2: Build a Clean, Abstracted User Interface**  
Users simply state what they want. They should **never see x402 complexity**. Behind the scenes:
- Multiple x402 agents coordinate
- Each calls a distinct endpoint
- Results aggregate invisibly
- One payment request at the right moment

**Requirement 3: Implement 2+ Working x402 Endpoints**  
Each endpoint performs a distinct function. Together they solve the business problem. Examples:
- Endpoint A: Search SSRN for academic papers
- Endpoint B: Query ProQuest database
- Endpoint C: Save selected papers to Google Drive

**Requirement 4: Surface a USDC Payment Request**  
Present payment at the right moment — after value is demonstrated, before delivery. Users pay once to unlock everything.

**Requirement 5: Obtain Green Cards for Verification**  
Each working endpoint must be verified by a technical verifier. You get a Green Card per verified endpoint.
- **Minimum to present:** 2 Green Cards (2 verified endpoints)
- **Extra credit:** 3+ Green Cards (more working endpoints)

---

## 🎮 Game Mechanics

### 🎟️ Consulting Tokens (×2 per team)
Each team receives **2 Consulting Tokens** at the start.

**What they do:** Redeem one token to get a **1-on-1 consulting session** with an Algorand team member.
- ⏱️ Time-boxed (15-20 min)
- 📋 Use for: Unblocking technical issues, validating use case, endpoint design guidance
- 🎯 Strategic use: Tokens are finite — use wisely!
- **Note:** Judges are NOT available for consulting

### 🏆 Green Cards
A **Green Card** is issued when a verifier confirms your endpoint works as described.

**What they do:** Act as your technical passport
- ✅ Minimum 2 Green Cards required to present to judges
- 📊 Signal depth of implementation (more cards = more endpoints)
- 🔐 Not about quality/novelty — only "does it work?"

**How to get them:**
1. Build endpoint in your server
2. Test it completely
3. Call over a verifier
4. They test it once
5. You get your Green Card

---

## 🧭 The x402 Philosophy

**x402 enables autonomous agents to transact on behalf of users.** These agents:
- Make requests independently
- Receive results
- Trigger payments when value is delivered
- Work silently in the background

**Key Principle: Abstraction**  
Users experience a clean product. They never see:
- x402 protocol details
- Agent orchestration
- Endpoint coordination
- Payment infrastructure

They only see: problem solved → cost displayed → payment made.

---

## ⚡ Quick Setup (5-Minute)

5. ✅ **T+180+:** Present & celebrate

**Success looks like:**
- 🧠 Clear, real business problem (not fake)
- 🎯 Clean UI (users don't see x402 internals)
- ⚙️ 2+ verified endpoints (Green Cards proven)
- 💳 Working payment flow
- 🎤 3-minute pitch judges understand

**Start here:**
1. Read [HACKATHON_STARTER_KIT.md](./HACKATHON_STARTER_KIT.md) (10 min)
2. Run setup above (5 min)
3. Check [x402-demo-server/HACKATHON_README.md](./x402-demo-server/HACKATHON_README.md) (5 min)
4. Pick a problem & build!

### **For Judges**

You're evaluating teams on **5 dimensions**:

| Criterion | Description | What to Listen For |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Real Business Value** | Does use case solve genuine problem? Would real users pay? | Specific friction, clear pain point, viable market |
| **Novelty** | Original & creative? Beyond obvious applications? | Unique angle, fresh perspective, not seen before |
| **Quality of Abstraction** | Does UI feel like product? Clean experience? | User doesn't need to understand x402, natural workflow |
| **Depth of Implementation** | How many working endpoints? How well integrated? | Green Cards held, endpoints work together smoothly |
| **Clarity of Presentation** | Is problem/solution communicated clearly in 3 min? | Story flows, easy to understand, compelling demo |

**Presentation Format:**
- 3 minutes: Pitch
- 2 minutes: Your Q&A
- Green Cards shown at start as proof

### **For Verifiers**

Your job: Confirm endpoints work as described (NOT judge quality).

**Process:**
1. Team calls you when endpoint is ready
2. Test the endpoint thoroughly
3. If it works → Issue Green Card
4. If it needs work → Give feedback, test again later

**Green Card Checklist:**
- [ ] Endpoint responds correctly
- [ ] Returns expected data format
- [ ] Handles errors gracefully
- [ ] Integrates with payment flow
- [ ] Works with frontend UI

**Note:** You're technical validation, not judges. Be thorough but encouraging!

### **For Organizers**

**Key Responsibilities:**
- 📋 Manage time rigorously (start/end on schedule)
- 🎫 Distribute Consulting Tokens & Green Cards
- 👥 Announce teams at T+0
- 🗣️ Introduce rules & philosophy
- 📊 Facilitate verifier rotation
- ⏱️ Hard stops at T+3:00 for pitches

## 🚀 Add Your First Endpoint (90 seconds)

**Step 1: Define in `endpoints.config.ts`**
```typescript
'GET /my-api': {
  accepts: [{
    scheme: 'exact',
    price: '$0.005',
    network: ALGORAND_TESTNET_CAIP2,
    payTo: avmAddress,
    extra: { asset: USDC_TESTNET_ASA_ID },
  }],
  description: 'My awesome paid endpoint',
},
```

**Step 2: Create `handlers/my-api.ts`**
```typescript
import type { Context } from 'hono';

export function handleMyApi(c: Context) {
  try {
    console.log('✓ PAYMENT VERIFIED');
    const result = { data: 'your value here' };
    return c.json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    return c.json({ error: 'Failed' }, 500);
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Register in `index.ts`**
```typescript
import { handleMyApi } from './handlers/my-api';
app.get('/my-api', handleMyApi);
```

**Step 4: Test**
```bash
curl http://localhost:4021/my-api  # Should return 402 ✓
```

## 🎯 Illustrative Example

**The Problem:**  
An academic researcher needs literature review for "Reverse Logistics" but papers are scattered across SSRN, ProQuest, and JSTOR. Manually searching each takes hours.

**The x402 Solution:**
1. **Frontend:** User types "Find me Reverse Logistics papers"
2. **Intent Agent (Backend):** Breaks request into 3 parallel tasks
3. **Endpoint 1:** Search SSRN → Returns list + price
4. **Endpoint 2:** Query ProQuest → Returns list + price
5. **Endpoint 3:** Check JSTOR → Returns list + price
6. **Aggregation:** Combine results, show user clean interface
7. **Payment:** Single USDC request for selected papers
8. **Fulfillment:** Deliver all to user's Google Drive automatically

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Real problem (researchers actually do this)
- ✅ Clean UX (users see results, not complexity)
- ✅ Multiple x402 endpoints (3 sources)
- ✅ One payment moment (user buys once)
- ✅ Agentic workflow (agents coordinate behind scenes)

## 📋 Judging Criteria

Teams are evaluated on:

| Criterion | Weight | Questions Judges Ask |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Real Business Value** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Does this solve a real problem? Would real users pay? Is there a market? |
| **Novelty** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Is this original? Creative angle? Not seen before? Fresh take? |
| **Quality of Abstraction** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Does UI feel like a product? Clean UX? User forgets about x402? |
| **Depth of Implementation** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Green Cards prove working endpoints. How many? Do they work together? |
| **Clarity of Presentation** | ⭐⭐⭐ | 3-min pitch easy to follow? Demo works? Questions answered clearly? |

>>>>>>> b158335e02f7651d45579fc817c1740d3761b359

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Port 4021 already in use:**
```bash
lsof -ti:4021 | xargs kill -9
npm start
```

**npm install fails:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

**CORS errors in browser:**
- Restart backend server
- Check frontend .env.local has correct API URL
- Check CORS headers in server logs

**Endpoint returns 402 but shouldn't:**
- Check wallet is connected
- Check wallet has USDC on TestNet
- Check price in endpoints.config.ts is set

**Type errors:**
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit  # See all TypeScript errors
```

**Server won't start:**
- Check .env file has AVM_ADDRESS
- Check FACILITATOR_URL is correct
- Check port 4021 is free

---

## 🏆 Winning Strategy

**Focus on solving a REAL problem, not a demo.**

1. **Pick a genuine problem** (T+0:15-T+0:45)
   - Interview yourselves: "Would I actually pay for this?"
   - Look for specific friction: time wasted, money lost, workflow blocked
   - Real ≠ famous; it can be niche but needs to be real

2. **Keep the interface clean** (T+1:00-T+2:30)
   - Hide x402 complexity completely
   - Users click, get results, see price, pay
   - No technical jargon in UI

3. **Build 2 working endpoints first** (T+1:00-T+2:00)
   - Use Consulting Tokens if stuck
   - Get both Green Cards verified
   - Get them working TOGETHER (not separately)

4. **Optional: 3rd endpoint for differentiation** (T+2:00-T+2:30)
   - Only if first two are solid
   - Extra Green Card = signal of depth

5. **Pitch with confidence** (T+3:00-T+3:05)
   - Lead with the problem (judges care about this first)
   - Show payment flow works (live if possible)
   - Mention Green Cards held as proof

**Judges' perspective:** Novelty is secondary to real value. They'll remember: "This team found a genuine problem and solved it cleanly with x402."

## 💡 Quick Reference: Consulting Tokens

You have **2 tokens per team**. Use them strategically:

**Good uses:**
- ✅ "Our endpoint keeps crashing, please debug"
- ✅ "We're unsure if our use case is valid, review?"
- ✅ "How should we structure this payment?"

**Bad uses:**
- ❌ "Build our endpoint for us"
- ❌ "Tell us what idea to pick" (brainstorm yourselves!)
- ❌ "Same question we already asked" (take notes)

**Pro tip:** Save at least 1 token for T+2:00-T+2:30 in case you hit a blocker.
